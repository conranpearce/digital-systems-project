# Digital Systems Project

This application manages and schedules TP-Link smart devices, helping an individual lower their local carbon impact.

The [National Grid's API](http://carbonintensity.org.uk/) has been used to provide carbon intensity related data.

TP-Link smart plugs and bulbs are accessed through HTTP requests to be turned on/off and scheduled.

MAMP is the packaged used for local development, using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML and CSS to program the application.

Cloud service files can be found [here](https://github.com/conranpearce/digital-systems-project-cloud).
